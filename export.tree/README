1.event
Onset is the starting timing of the maintenance phase(please refer to our paper).
These unit is second
The duration of the maintenance phase is always 12 sec.
trial_type is letter or fingerspelling(please refer to our paper)
Repetition time is 1 sec.

The duration of the encoding and decision phase depends on the sequence length (4-7 sequences) and stimulus type (fingerspelling or letter).
('Number' is sequence length (4,5,6 or 7) and 'letterfinger' is task condition (1:letter or 2:fingerspelling))

'letterfinger'= 1 and 'Number' = 4 : the duration of the encoding or decision phase is 2 sec
'letterfinger'= 1 and 'Number' = 5 : the duration of the encoding or decision phase is 2.5 sec
'letterfinger'= 1 and 'Number' = 6 : the duration of the encoding or decision phase is 3 sec
'letterfinger'= 1 and 'Number' = 6 : the duration of the encoding or decision phase is 3.5 sec
'letterfinger'= 2 and 'Number' = 4 : the duration of the encoding or decision phase is 3 sec
'letterfinger'= 2 and 'Number' = 5 : the duration of the encoding or decision phase is 3.5 sec
'letterfinger'= 2 and 'Number' = 6 : the duration of the encoding or decision phase is 4 sec
'letterfinger'= 2 and 'Number' = 6 : the duration of the encoding or decision phase is 4.5 sec

2. session('ses')
You will find some missing session. Because scanning sessions whose behavioral accuracy was less than 70 % were excluded from further analysis(page 4, line 39-40).

3. Our neuroimaging analysis
I am afraid that the first level analysis is complicated for you. Please refer to Page 4, line 31-40

General Comments
----------------


Defacing
--------
Pydeface was used on all anatomical images to ensure deindentification of subjects. The code
can be found at https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface

Quality Control
---------------
Mriqc was run on the dataset. Results are located in derivatives/mriqc. Learn more about it here: https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Where to discuss the dataset
----------------------------
1) www.openfmri.org/dataset/ds******/ See the comments section at the bottom of the dataset
page.
2) www.neurostars.org Please tag any discussion topics with the tags openfmri and dsXXXXXX.
3) Send an email to submissions@openfmri.org. Please include the accession number in
your email.

Known Issues
------------
Following files as reported by vids-validator warnings are not included with the dataset. AS per submitter"These missing data were excluded because the behavioral accuracy rate was less than 70%for these scanning sessions."

1: Not all subjects contain the same files. Each subject should contain the same number of files with the same naming unless some files are known to be missing. (code: 38 - INCONSISTENT_SUBJECTS)
